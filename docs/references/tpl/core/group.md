# core.group

> Template proxy for grouping controllers in the animator UI

## Overview

`core.group` is used to create logical controller groups that serve as organizational aids within the animator interface. This module does not generate any controllers or deformers.

## Options

- `main` (*bool*, default: `off`): When enabled, the group is parented directly under the `all` group for top-level organization.
