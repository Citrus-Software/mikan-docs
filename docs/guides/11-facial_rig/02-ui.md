# UI Design

## Look-at System

Next, we add a hierarchy to manage the **look-at system** with:

- an **eyes** module: core>joints, type transform, skin tag unchecked, placed between the two eyes,
- a **look_at** module, identical but placed in front of the face, controlling the gaze direction of both eyes,
- a **look_target** module, used to control each eye individually.

## Facial interface

To set up the **facial interface** intended for animators, we start with:

- a **face_panel**, created using a **core>xform** module, with the **parent = parent** option so that the panel group is attached to the face group.

We then create the rigger section and the animator interface.

### Rigger section

- **shp_lids**: core>xform module where all blink and eyelid-movement parameters will be stored.
- **shp_lips**: module for lip-related settings.
- **chan_face**: centralizes and manages all facial-rig connections, in the spirit of the BCS plugin, by aggregating all attributes onto a single controller.
- **shp_face**: node on which the facial poses will be recorded.

### Animator section

On the animator side, we set up the hierarchy used to build the interface:

- **frame_look**, a core>xform module providing a 2D interface for eye animation.
    - a look **core>joints** module for the global movement of both eyes,
    - a look_eye **core>joints** module for the individual movement of each eye,
    - a loc_look **core>xform** used to collect the movements of both c_look and c_look_eye.
- **frame_lipsync**, a core>xform module for the 2D mouth-movement interface.
    - a **lipsync** core>joints module to handle mouth opening.
- **face_up**, a core>joints module grouping all upper-face poses (eyes, eyebrows).
- **face_dn**, a core>joints module grouping all lower-face poses (mouth, teeth, cheeks).
